Title: Bioactivity Similarity Index (BSI)
Description: >-
  Predicts whether two compounds share similar bioactivity profiles based on
  their binding behavior to protein targets. The model uses ECFP4 fingerprints
  (256-bit Morgan radius 2) summed for compound pairs, fed through a deep neural
  network trained on ChEMBL-derived active-active (similar) and active-decoy
  (dissimilar) pairs with Tanimoto filtering. Outputs a score between 0
  (dissimilar binding) and 1 (similar binding).
Mode: Pretrained
Task:
  - Pairwise similarity prediction
Input:
  - Compound pair
Input Dimension: 2
Input Shape: Pair
Output:
  - Score
Output Type: Float
Output Dimension: 1
Output Shape: Single
Interpretation: >-
  Higher scores indicate that the two compounds are more likely to share
  bioactivity profiles (i.e., bind similar protein targets). The model was
  trained with a Tanimoto threshold of 0.40 to avoid trivially similar pairs.
